# unsplash-api-gallery

Random Unsplash Image Generation using the Unsplash Get Random Photo API. 

This application was built for an assignment during a client-side JavaScript course at Georgian College, as an introduction to third party APIs.

The application allows the user to click a change image button that will then fetch JSON data from the API and inject the data into the respective elements in the HTML document.
